# Management Approach

## Meetings and planning
We had 3 daily meetings, accumulating a max of 15 minutes of meetings per day.
- 2 daily standups (beginning of the day and at lunch)
- 1 retrospective per day (end of day)

We had a high level plan to keep us focused on getting to MVP and made daily checklists for the more granular tasks.

- merged to features to dev when features were completed
- merged from dev branch to master for deploys
